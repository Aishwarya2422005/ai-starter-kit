What is the peak efficiency of the ADP2107?,Extremely high 97% efficiency,human_eval
Does the ADP2107 have a switching frequency > 1.2 MHz?  This is a hard requirement for my application.,"1.2 MHz switching frequency, so No",human_eval
What is the slope compensation ramp value for the ADP2107?  Why do I need slope compensation in the first place?,"1.38 A/micro-sec
Stabilizes the internal current control loop when operating beyond 50% duty cycle
to prevent subharmonic oscillations",human_eval
"Considering the ADP2107, what is minimum L value for a Vin = 4.2V and Vout = 1.5V?","L = inductance in Henry (H)
The minimum inductor value required for the ADP2107 when the input voltage is 4.2V and the
output voltage is 1.5V is 1.21 µH",human_eval
What are the conditions that would make the ADP2107 go into a thermal shutdown?,"The ADP2107 will go into thermal shutdown if the junction temperature rises above 140°C.
This can be caused by high current operation, poor circuit board design, and/or high ambient
temperature. When thermal shutdown occurs, the ADP2107 will not return to operation
until the on-chip temperature drops below 100°C.",human_eval
"What are the external components values of the ADP2107 for a Vout = 1.5V?  I am looking for the values of the input and output caps, L, and the values for the compensation R and C?","1st answer:
L = 1.5 micro-H, R_comp = 70 k-Omega, C_comp = 120 pF, C_in = 10 micro-F, C_out = 10 micro-F
2nd answer:
L = 1.5 micro-H, R_comp = 140 k-Omega, C_comp = 68 pF, C_in = 10 micro-F, C_out = 22 micro-F",human_eval

The MAX5090B is my leading candidate for my design.  Can you tell me what the expected efficiency for my design is if my Vin =12V at a Iout = 1A?,"88% for Vin = 12V and Iout = 1A
Note it says up to 92% efficiency",human_eval
I have a portable battery-powered design that I am working on.  Vout is 1.2V.  I am using a 1 D-cell battery.   Will using the ADP5303 work?,No,human_eval
I am using 2 D-cell batteries in series in a portable battery-powered design that I am working on.  Vout is 1.2V.  Will the ADP5303 work with the D-cell batts in series?,yes,human_eval
What does the active discharge feature of the ADP5300 used for?  How do I disable it? ,"It's an optional, factory programmable discharge switch from the switching node to ground. This switch turns on when its associated regulator is disabled, which helps discharge the output capacitor quickly. The typical value of the discharge switch is 290 Ω for the regulator.
The discharge function is disabled by default.",human_eval
