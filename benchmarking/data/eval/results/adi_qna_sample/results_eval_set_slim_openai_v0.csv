 'adp2107\n PWM MODE OPERATION\nIn PWM mode, the ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 operate at a fixed frequency of $1.2 \\mathrm{MHz}$ set by an internal oscillator. At the start of each oscillator cycle, the P-channel MOSFET switch is turned on, putting a positive voltage across the inductor. Current in the inductor increases until the current sense signal crosses the peak inductor current level that turns off the P-channel MOSFET switch and turns on the N-channel MOSFET synchronous rectifier. This puts a negative voltage across the inductor, causing the inductor current to decrease. The synchronous rectifier stays on for the remainder of the cycle, unless the inductor current reaches zero, which causes the zero-crossing comparator to turn off the N-channel MOSFET. The peak inductor current is set by the voltage on the COMP pin. The COMP pin is the output of a transconductance error amplifier that compares the feedback voltage with an internal $0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$ reference.\n']","1.
