This puts a negative voltage across the inductor, causing the inductor current to decrease.

19,What control scheme does the ADP2107 use under light load conditions to save power?,"['adp2107\n GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 are low quiescent current, synchronous, step-down dc-to-dc converters in a compact $4 \\mathrm{~mm} \\times$ $4 \\mathrm{~mm}$ LFCSP package. At medium to high load currents, these devices use a current mode, constant frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) control scheme for excellent stability and transient response. To ensure the longest battery life in portable applications, the ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 use a pulse frequency modulation (PFM) control scheme under light load conditions that reduces switching frequency to save power.\nThe ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 run from input voltages of $2.7 \\mathrm{~V}$ to $5.5 \\mathrm{~V}$, allowing single $\\mathrm{Li}+/ \\mathrm{Li}-$ polymer cell, multiple alkaline/NiMH cells, PCMCIA, and other standard power sources.

 'adp2107\n CONTROL SCHEME\nThe ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 operate with a fixed frequency, peak current mode PWM control architecture at medium to high loads for high efficiency, but shift to a variable frequency PFM control scheme at light loads for lower quiescent current. When operating in fixed frequency PWM mode, the duty cycle of the integrated switches is adjusted to regulate the output voltage, but when operating in PFM mode at light loads, the switching frequency is adjusted to regulate the output voltage.\nThe ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 operate in the PWM mode only when the load current is greater than the pulse-skipping threshold current. At load currents below this value, the converter smoothly transitions to the PFM mode of operation.\n'
 'adp2107\n THEORY OF OPERATION\nThe ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 are step-down, dc-to-dc converters that use a fixed frequency, peak current mode architecture with an integrated high-side switch and low-side synchronous rectifier. The high 1.2 MHz switching frequency and tiny 16-lead, $4 \\mathrm{~mm} \\times 4 \\mathrm{~mm}$ LFCSP package allow for a small stepdown dc-to-dc converter solution. The integrated high-side switch (P-channel MOSFET) and synchronous rectifier (N-channel MOSFET) yield high efficiency at medium to heavy loads. Light load efficiency is improved by smoothly transitioning to variable frequency PFM mode.\nThe ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 (ADJ) operate with an input voltage from $2.7 \\mathrm{~V}$ to $5.5 \\mathrm{~V}$ and regulate an output voltage down to $0.8 \\mathrm{~V}$. The ADP2105/ADP2106/ADP2107 are also available with preset output voltage options of $3.3 \\mathrm{~V}, 1.8 \\mathrm{~V}, 1.5 \\mathrm{~V}$, and $1.2 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n']",The ADP2107 uses a pulse frequency modulation (PFM) control scheme under light load conditions to save power.,Pulse frequency modulation (PFM),0.9999999999666667,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.957517168148366,0.7144905805028865
